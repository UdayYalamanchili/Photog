Android application which lets you click a picture and upload to a flask server

1. Run the flask server 'python flaskserver.py' assuming you've already installed flask.
2. Once it is up and running, open the 'android' folder in android studio.
3. You can connect an android phone or use an emulator to launch the app.
4. Once the gradle has finished building, run the app. 
5. Once you click a picture, you are asked to choose a category and then upload it.
6. You can check the terminal for a push request from the app.
7. If there are no directories created for the categories, new folders will be created (at the source file location) and the images are stored in them.
